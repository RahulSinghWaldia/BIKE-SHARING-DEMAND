# Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Data Science Project
## Overview
This data science project focuses on analyzing the demand for bike sharing in Seoul, South Korea. The goal is to understand the factors that influence bike rental patterns and develop models that can predict the bike demand accurately. By leveraging data analysis techniques, time series analysis, and machine learning algorithms, we aim to provide valuable insights for bike sharing service providers and urban planners.

## Project Steps
## 1. Data Collection
Collect the Seoul bike sharing dataset, which typically includes information such as date, time, weather conditions, rental station details, and bike rental counts. Obtain the dataset from reliable sources, such as public transportation authorities or open data repositories. Ensure the dataset covers a significant time period and contains relevant attributes for analysis. Link to dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/seoul-bike-sharing-demand-prediction

## 2. Data Exploration and Cleaning
Explore the dataset to understand the available variables, their distributions, and any missing or inconsistent data. Identify outliers and handle missing values through techniques like imputation or deletion. Clean the dataset by removing irrelevant or duplicate entries to ensure data quality.

## 3. Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the dataset to prepare it for analysis. Perform transformations such as data normalization or standardization if required. Extract relevant features such as time of day, day of the week, or weather conditions that may impact bike rental demand. Encode categorical variables appropriately.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis
Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the Seoul bike sharing dataset. Visualize the data using techniques like line plots, bar plots, or heatmaps. Analyze factors that influence bike rental demand, such as weather conditions, day of the week, or rental station locations. Identify any seasonal patterns or trends.

## 5. Time Series Analysis
Apply time series analysis techniques to understand the temporal patterns in bike rental demand. Explore concepts such as seasonality, trend, and autocorrelation. Decompose the time series data to separate these components and analyze their contributions. Utilize forecasting methods such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or Prophet to predict future bike rental demand.

## 6. Feature Engineering
Engineer new features that may improve the accuracy of demand prediction. Consider variables such as public holidays, events, or promotions that may influence bike rental patterns. Incorporate lagged variables to capture the historical demand behavior. Create additional time-related features to account for temporal dependencies.

## 7. Model Selection and Training
Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm or time series forecasting method for predicting bike rental demand. Consider algorithms such as linear regression, random forests, gradient boosting, or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. Split the dataset into training and validation sets and train the model using the training data. Optimize hyperparameters to improve model performance.

## 8. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or R-squared. Compare the model's performance against baseline models or benchmarks. Validate the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities using the validation dataset.

## 9. Documentation and Reporting
Document the project, including data sources, methodology, and key findings. Provide clear explanations of the analysis steps, visualizations, and model development. Share the code and documentation on GitHub to make it accessible to others. Include insights and recommendations for bike sharing service providers or urban planners based on the analysis results.

## Conclusion
The Seoul bike sharing demand data science project aims to analyze the factors influencing bike rental demand in Seoul and develop accurate prediction models. By leveraging data analysis techniques, time series analysis, and machine learning algorithms, we can provide valuable insights for bike sharing service providers and urban planners. The project's documentation and code can be shared on GitHub, allowing others to learn and apply bike sharing demand
